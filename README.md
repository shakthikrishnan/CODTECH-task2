OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT:STUDENT GRADE TRACKER

The Student Grade Tracker project is designed to help users manage and track student grades efficiently using Python.
The application will provide functionalities to input, update, and analyze grades for multiple students, allowing for easy tracking of academic performance over time.

Key Features
*Add New Students: Functionality to input and store details of new students.
*Record Grades: Ability to add, update, and manage grades for each student across multiple subjects.
